# S03 Workpad — Mic + loopback capture into a mixed 16 kHz mono WAV

## Status

`todo`

## Base / sync

2026-06-15 (update): **S02 has landed** — user-confirmed the Windows GUI smoke
test (AC1/2/3/6), PR #2 squash-merged to `main` as `a6073bf`. This branch was
then rebased `--onto main cef8f5d` (dropping the redundant S02 commits) and
force-pushed; it now sits on a clean post-S02 `main`. PR #3 auto-closed when the
S02 base branch was deleted → superseded by **PR #4** (base `main`, ready).
The S02-land gate is **cleared**; S03 implementation can begin.

Originally: branch was based on the S02 tip `cef8f5d` (off S02's work, not
pre-S02 `main`) so the harness state it sits on (ADR-0004, TM-004) stayed
consistent with what S03's docs assume.

## Notes

2026-06-15: Authored the full S03 docs bundle this session — initiative
note, story packet (`S03-mic-loopback-mixed-wav.md`, 8 ACs), and
`S03-mic-loopback-mixed-wav.{design,execplan,validation}.md` — via
subagent-driven drafting (Tasks 1 and 2 of this docs effort). This session
(Task 3) adds ADR-0005, this workpad, TM-005..008, and two
`HARNESS_BACKLOG.md` entries.

**No Rust code was written or attempted.** S03 implementation is gated on
S02 landing to `main` (see "Next step" below).

## What this session did

- Authored `docs/decisions/0005-audio-capture-library.md` (windows-rs WASAPI
  decision, ADR-0001-shaped).
- Authored this workpad.
- Appended TM-005..008 to `docs/TEST_MATRIX.md` (status `planned`, story
  `S03`).
- Appended two entries to `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md`: extracting a high-risk
  story template, and reconciling the Rust thread-budget drift.

## Decisions made

- **ADR-0005**: `windows-rs` WASAPI direct (not `cpal`, not vendoring
  meetily) — see `docs/decisions/0005-audio-capture-library.md`.
- Three design sub-decisions resolved in `S03-mic-loopback-mixed-wav.design.md`
  §5:
  - §5.1 — two-stream sync model: **shared ring buffer + real-time mix**.
  - §5.2 — WAV write policy: **streaming append with header fixup** (write
    PCM frames continuously, back-patch the WAV header's size fields on
    Stop/finalize).
  - §5.3 — partial-file recovery: **auto-repair on next launch** (no DB
    bookkeeping; detect a partial WAV header at startup and fix it in
    place).
- Branch was deliberately based on the S02 tip (`cef8f5d`), not pre-S02
  `main`, so this story's harness files (ADR numbering, TM row numbering,
  backlog) stay consistent with S02's in-flight state rather than diverging
  and requiring a reconciliation merge later.

## Open risks / not attempted

1. **meetily reference not located on this machine.** ADR-0005 and the
   execplan treat meetily's `windows.rs` / `AudioMixerRingBuffer` as a
   read-only reference implementation, but it has not been confirmed to
   exist in this environment. Execplan Step 0 must locate it (e.g. clone or
   find a local copy) or fall back to MS WASAPI docs + the Chronicler design
   spec if unavailable.
2. **Thread-budget drift.** S03's design (§7) requires 3 Rust threads (mic
   capture, loopback capture, mixer/writer) vs. the 2 documented in
   `CLAUDE.md` ("1 capture thread + 1 VAD/chunker thread") — and Phase 1 has
   no VAD thread yet. This drift is logged in `docs/HARNESS_BACKLOG.md` and
   needs architect ratification before `CLAUDE.md` / `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
   are updated.
3. **All S03 ACs require a Windows GUI and real audio devices** (mic +
   render-device loopback, VU meters, WAV playback/ffprobe). None of AC1–AC8
   can be verified by an agent alone — manual smoke tests are required per
   `validation.md`.
4. No Rust code exists yet for this story — implementation has not started
   (intentionally; gated below).

## What was not attempted

- Any Rust implementation (audio capture, mixer, WAV writer, VU meter
  events, React UI for the meters).
- Locating/confirming the meetily reference (execplan Step 0).
- Any build, test, or `cargo`/`pnpm` command — this session is docs-only.

## Next step for a cold-start agent

1. **Land S02 first.** Run S02's Windows GUI smoke test (see
   `docs/stories/phase-0-scaffold/S02-fastapi-sidecar-health-sqlite.workpad.md`
   "Next step for a cold-start agent"): verify AC1 (teardown — no orphan
   `chronicler-backend-*.exe`), AC2 (`get_backend_port`), AC3 (Ping renders
   `/health` JSON), AC6 (Backend unavailable UI state). Check off those ACs
   and land PR #2 to `main`.
2. **Rebase** `story/s03-mic-loopback-mixed-wav` onto post-S02 `main`.
3. **Confirm or locate the meetily reference** per execplan Step 0; fall
   back to MS WASAPI loopback docs + the Chronicler design spec if it is
   unavailable.
4. **Execute `execplan.md` steps 1→9**, TDD-first: write `wav_writer` and
   `mixer` unit tests before the implementation (per
   `superpowers:test-driven-development`).
5. **Record evidence** in `S03-mic-loopback-mixed-wav.md`'s Evidence
   section as each AC is verified (most require a human at a Windows GUI
   with real audio devices — see `validation.md`).
6. Transition story status `todo` → `in_progress` only after the pull
   (rebase) and this workpad are updated to reflect the new base.
